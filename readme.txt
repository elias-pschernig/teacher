Speedhack 2015 entry by Allefant (elias)

To compile, compile c/*.c and c/land/land.c. land.c is my old collection
of code snippets and was not written during speedhack. Also sound.c and
music.c are from an older speedhack entry and used to synthesize the
background music. Everything else was written during the 72 hours.

The rules:


Genre requirements
Seedlings

Your game must involve caring for something that, for better or worse, is under your guardianship.

Care for a garden, watch children in a daycare, mentor a mentee. The outcome of the game must revolve around the decisions you make and the guidance you give.
Technical requirements
There are two technical requirements:

    Text Interactivity

    At some point you must interact with the game through written text, either free-form as in text adventures, or a dialog where the player can choose from pre-written responses.

    Selecting an option from a menu as part of a title or configuration screen does not count.
    Particle Madness

    There must be a fairly large particle engine (>500 particles) somewhere in the game.

    It does not need to serve any purpose.

Artistic requirements
There are two artistic requirements:

    Sound Annoyance

    When a player is doing badly, play the most annoying sound ever heard* on a loop. Only doing better or forfeiting will cause the sound to stop.

    * Actually, anything obnoxious will do.
    Physical Criminality

    Your game must have, and flamboyantly reject, an opportunity to obey the laws of physics. For example, you could distort space-time, invert gravity, make a world where it's impossible to create a perpetual motion machine that doesn't keep getting faster and faster, or simply decree that water is flammable. Bonus points if you can make your penchant for illegal behaviour an integral part of a fun game.

Bonus rules
There is one optional bonus rule:

    Act of Sequel

    Pick a game from any previous Speedhack competition and make a sequel to it! Pick up to two rules in this competition and replace them with rules from that year's competition.

    The sequel must share some significant details with the original game: a continuation of the plot, the same characters, etc. It need not be the same genre.

    The swapped rules must be in the same category. i.e., An artistic rule must be swapped with an artistic rule. Therefore, it is not possible to swap the Bonus rule for fear of creating a world ending paradox.

    If invoking this rule, clearly state in the game's README which rules have been replaced.
